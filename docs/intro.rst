What is this?
-------------

MySQL-AutoXtraBackup is a commandline tool written in Python3 based on
Percona XtraBackup.
It is aimed to simplify the usage of XtraBackup in
daily basis and to help backup admin in certain tasks.

Why you need this?
------------------

The idea for this tool, came from my hard times after accidentally
deleting the table data.
There was a full backup and 12 incremental backups.
It took me 20 minutes to prepare necessary commands for preparing
backups. If you have compressed + encrypted backups you need also,
decrypt and decompress, which is going to add extra time for preparing
backups. Then I decided to automate this process. In other words,
preparing necessary commands for backup and prepare stage were
automated.

After a while, there was an issue, the log table was dropped on test
server for testing our reaction speed :)
I have decided to recover only that table(partial recovery).
But still did a bunch of manual tasks, which was quite time consuming process. That was the reason for
implementing partial recovery functionality. So the necessary actions
for restoring single table was added to automate this process as well.

The recent thing is, --test_mode for testing XtraBackup[So it is for me, or for somebody who wants to find bug in XtraBackup]

If you think that those reasons are not enough - Then just believe me
you need this :)

Is it production ready?
-----------------------

Well, we have famous answer for this - "It depends!".
Basically this tool is based on Percona XtraBackup and it is using XtraBackup's
functionalities, there is also a 'mysqlfrm' (from mysql-utilities) tool
usage which is quite safe, happy tool.
For me, I have used it in production environment after testing for a while in test servers.
But to be clear, just test it enough to be confident.
